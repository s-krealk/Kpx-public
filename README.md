# Kpx-public
A general use web proxy/unblocker

This is an in-progress repoistory, do not expect this to be very polished or advanced. It is a cut-down version of another version i am working on, that i don't want to release yet, but might in the future.

Some features include:
-optional account requirement
-proxy page with tabs

for now, to get this to work, git clone Ultraviolet-static and Ultraviolet-app into the root of the repository and change the "publicPath" in the "src/run-settings.js" file to the release option, as well as copying the "files" folder into the "public" folder of Ultraviolet-static. in the "src/run-settings.js" file you can also find the option to turn on passwords/usernames.

note: with passwords and usernames turned on, the site is only accessible through the "/error" page (which is a login page disguised as an error page), where you will find the input boxes under the text.
